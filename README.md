Some codes about kernel-based independence testing using HSIC.
Methods concern both iid data and random processes (the latter is based on Chwialkowski and Gretton, 2014).

Sped-up procedures are also coded using either random Fourier features, Gamma approximations (see El Amri and Marrel, 2024) or spectral considerations.
